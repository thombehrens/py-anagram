## [Version 1][2]

This was my first python script since college! I feel like I already understand python more now than I did then.

I learned the basics of `venv`, and of using Python in VS Code. I actually got to learn quite a bit about how debugging works in VS Code, since Salesforce development in VS Code doesn't have any good local debugging tools (only bad ones).

I _really_ like the syntax of Python. And I love how easy it is to get started.

The thing that tripped me up was learning to use `list.copy()` in order to duplicate a list - it took me about 30 minutes to figure out that when I was removing words from `valid_words`, I was also removing words from `words`, which was making my loop end before it had gone through every element and was throwing everything off.

This thing takes a long time to run. I am sure there are ways to do it more efficiently. I could get rid of `find_valid_words` and just do an n^2 nested for loop for the whole list... that would definitely look cleaner... I'll be interested to see if that runs faster.

Another thing that has thrown me off is needing to use the i+=1 loop iterator for the inner while loop. I am going to try to find way to get rid of that... I've either omitted it or put it at the wrong level of indentation a few times and the only way I realize it's stuck in an infinite loop is when the fans on my MacBook Air kick in.

I wonder if I can write this program (and using a dictionary this huge) in such a way that doesn't turn on my computer fans?

Execution times:

## [Version 2][3]

Ok: I tried getting rid of the `find_valid_words` and it totally failed... I gave the program about 10 minutes to churn through it and it didn't come back.

I did make a few quality of life improvements, basically by delegating the logic of each comparison to [collections.Counter()][4], which is an awesome library.

There are a few unsavory words that you can make from the letters in "documenting", so I also added in a step that takes out profanity ðŸ™‚.

That ended up prompting the need to put in case insensitivity, since the bad words dictionary is lowercase/case sensitive.

Execution times:
48.79525709152222 seconds

51.307101249694824 seconds

A fun and unexpected aside: I've been measuring execution times on my personal laptop, which is a mid-2020 MacBook Air with an Intel i5 chip. In addition to this project, this week I also set up an ubuntu ssh server on an old laptop I have, an early-2015 MacBook Pro with an Intel i7 chip. It was really slow (and hot, and loud) as a 6-year old Mac (I had really put it through the ringer) - but as a new Ubuntu machine, it is flying through this code.

Execution times (on the i7 Ubuntu):
8.063069581985474 seconds
7.864361047744751 seconds
7.677416086196899 seconds
